# Cornelia Dataset Notebook

This is the repository for my Jupyter Notebook used in the analysis of the Cornelia dataset for Introduction to Digital Humanities for the academic year 24-25. 

To view the notebook please look at [digital_humanities_project.ipynb](https://github.com/Palinghamer/DH-Cornelia/blob/main/digital_humanities_project.ipynb). The cleaned and enriched dataset is saved as [Cornelia-BRGA818_2.csv](https://github.com/Palinghamer/DH-Cornelia/blob/main/Cornelia-BRGA818_2.csv). 

The images folder contains the graphs generated for the report, the map folder contains the shapeform file used for mapping with geopandas.
